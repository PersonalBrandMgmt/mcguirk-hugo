In an effort to diversify my reading content, a peer recommended Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig. The book is a look into the author's values, as they arise from travels with family and friends. This cross-discipline perspective of his personal trip through middle America examines bits of memorable interactions with his son as well as a couple with which they travel. The analyses of moments educate in the philosophic realm and make connections with the reader on the topic of the human experience. As the title alludes, Pirsig is constantly listening to and tweaking his motorcycle, a commentary on the importance of staying in check with one's mind and body. I found this read to be a refreshing switch from inquiries on markets to inquiries on values.
