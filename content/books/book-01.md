As a research analyst for the Deacon Fund, my investment strategy was heavily weighted in value stocks. When exploring the return differences of value and growth stocks in my quantitative finance class, I was surprised to find that the returns on value stocks tended to outpace that of growth stocks. It was not until I read Joel Greenblatt that I understood the philosophy behind investing in value stocks for huge returns. After a classmate recommended I read 'You Can Be a Stock Market Genius', I finally appreciated the fruits of market inefficiencies. While the stock market may cause a company’s shares to fluctuate, the underlying discounted cash flows and the inner aspects of each business typically do not vary as drastically as the price suggests. Greenblatt has been able to take advantage of value stocks over the years for remarkable returns. I look forward to employing the investment strategies in this book and following his future publications.
